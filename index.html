        <p>A console application, in the context of C#, is an application that takes input and displays output at a command line console with access to three basic data streams: standard input, standard output and standard error.

            A console application facilitates the reading and writing of characters from a console - either individually or as an entire line. It is the simplest form of a C# program and is typically invoked from the Windows command prompt. A console application usually exists in the form of a stand-alone executable file with minimal or no graphical user interface (GUI).
        </p>
         Step 1: To open the console in Firefox, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option +K (on a Mac) or Ctrl +Shift +J (on Windows). As an alternative, you can right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect Element" to show the developer window.
            Step 2: Click the "Console" tab in that window.
            Step 3: From there, repeat the action that is causing you trouble and take a full screenshot of the Console dialogue.
